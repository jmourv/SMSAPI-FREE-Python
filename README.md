# Using Free SMS API with Python
A piece of code to send an SMS to your mobile phone using the Free SMS API service. This script use Urllib3, so it's work with Python 3.

# Why use Free API ?
You can use this API to notify you of an error, a news item or a notification. The possibilities are endless

# How to use Free API ?
The API relies on a URL with this information in: the identification key, the user number and the message (with percent-encoding).

To find your owns keys, go to your [Free account](https://mobile.free.fr/moncompte/) and enter your credentials to log in. (If you use your smartphone with data activated to connect to log into your accont, you will be automatically logged in.)

Click on "manage your options" and search "SMS Notifications" option. If the option is disabled, click on "activated". Find and copy "Hello World !" link (like https://smsapi.free-mobile.fr/sendmsg?user=**12345678**&pass=**usb42qe7g2n8r**&msg=**Hello%20World%20!**.)

For my example, I have 12345678 as user number, usb42qe7g2n8r as authentication key and Hello%20World%20! (Hello world) as message.

Now, for use Python script, I have to inform 12345678 in USER_NUMBER variable, usb42qe7g2n8r in USER_KEY and your message in MSG. MSG will be a simple string (not in percent-encoding) because we use the POST method, that encodes the message for us.

Now you can integrate this piece of code to send you SMS notifications. It is not amazing ?

# Things not so important
The script has a conditional structure to perform actions based on how it sent the SMS. (If it was successfully sent (200) or with errors (400 < 500)). You can remove this part safely or add actions.
